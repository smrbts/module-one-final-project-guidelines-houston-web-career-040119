Description
Welcome to our little fledgling project, NewsFeedMe! NewsFeedMe is an exclusive application that both hangry customers and business-savy restaurants can connect with each other through subscriptions. By signing up for the beta, a customer can "follow" their favorite restaurant for exclusive offers only available to NewsFeedMe members. A restaurant can FLEX its popularity muscles with an active sub count, as well as managing what customly exclusive offers it is presenting through NewsFeedMe. Have we mentioned exclusive yet?
