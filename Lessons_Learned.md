At the beginning we struggled to make an effective navigation structure for our app. Originally we were able to traverse through menus but only linearly due to all of our code being in a single document without breaks. Thanks to the help of our colleagues in our Cohort (shoutout to Ryan and Chris) we were able to organize our menu navigation much better through using while loops. P.s. Huge shoutout to Scott AKA ScottyBoi AKA CurlyBoiOG for being patient and helping us trouble different aspects we ran into.

Three things we learned during this project:
    1. We now have a much better understand of TTY::prompt and how to implement that into our code to make it look cleaner
    2. We have a greater understanding of how ActiveRecord makes our life easier when working and updating databases.
    3. We also learned how critical (and helpful) it is to stick with Single Responsibilty Principle when working with multiple files and methods

If we could add anything to this project it would be having more time, since we had to rebuild the entire structure from bottom up on Thursday. While we did have enough to cover the main points of what was needed, we feel we could have implemented extra parts hints the updates mentioned throughout the app. We had quite a few "stretch goals" and while we got to work on a few, we were really hoping to have gotten to them all.
